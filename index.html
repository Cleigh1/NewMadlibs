        <p>(CNN)President <span class="noun">Joe Biden</span> on Thursday provided new insight into his <span class="adjective">ongoing</span> negotiations with <span class="noun">Democrats</span>, laying out in the most specific terms to date what will and won't be included in a compromise budget measure that contains the bulk of his <span class="adjective">sweeping</span> <span class="adjective">domestic</span> agenda.

            The measure looks to expand the social safety net, combat climate change and  <span class="verb">raise taxes on the wealthy.</span>
            <span class="noun">Biden</span> flatly said during a CNN town hall in Baltimore that he would not support a work requirement for the child tax credit -- a provision <span class="adjective">moderate</span> West Virginia Democratic Sen. <span class="noun">Joe Manchin</span> is <span class="verb">pushing</span> for within the Democrats' massive social spending bill. The President also confirmed to town hall moderator Anderson Cooper that a paid parental leave provision in his social safety net plan has been <span class="verb">narrowed down from 12 weeks to 4 weeks.</span></p>

            <p>It would be <span class="verb">a "reach,"</span> the President said, to include dental, vision and hearing coverage in Medicare, a <span class="adjective">key</span> priority for progressives, saying 
                <span class="noun">Manchin</span> opposed the provision -- and that he believed Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an Arizona Democrat, was <span class="verb">against it </span> as well. Instead, he said he was working to include an $800 voucher for dental coverage and was still negotiating vision coverage.</p>
